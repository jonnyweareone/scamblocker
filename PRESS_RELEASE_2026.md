**UK CPaaS Provider SONIQ Labs Launches AI-Powered Phone Service to Combat £1.2 Billion Annual Scam Crisis**

*ScamBlocker™ Uses Voice AI to Screen Unknown Callers Before Vulnerable People Answer - First B2C Product from Leading Communications Platform Provider*

**Portsmouth, UK – 21 January 2026** – SONIQ Labs, a UK-based Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) provider operating under We Are One 1 Limited, has launched ScamBlocker™, a revolutionary AI-powered digital landline service designed to protect UK households from the escalating telephone scam epidemic that costs British families over £1.2 billion annually.

The service, which went live this month, uses real-time voice AI to intercept and screen unknown callers *before* the phone rings, preventing scammers from ever reaching vulnerable individuals. Unlike existing call-blocking services that react after the damage is done, ScamBlocker provides proactive protection by analyzing caller intent in real-time.

ScamBlocker marks SONIQ Labs' first consumer-facing product, leveraging the company's enterprise CPaaS infrastructure to deliver advanced telecommunications protection directly to UK households and through the SONIQ Labs partner channel.

## The Problem: An Epidemic Hidden in Plain Sight

According to UK Finance and Action Fraud data, 81% of successful fraud attempts begin with a phone call. Elderly and vulnerable adults are disproportionately targeted, with many victims never reporting losses due to shame, fear of losing independence, or not recognizing they've been scammed.

"We're not just solving a technical problem—we're addressing a social crisis," said Philippa Highfield, Director at We Are One 1 Limited. "When elderly parents lose thousands of pounds to phone scammers, they often hide it from family for weeks or months. By the time anyone knows, the damage is irreversible. ScamBlocker changes that equation completely."

## How ScamBlocker Works

ScamBlocker operates as a complete digital landline replacement that costs less than traditional phone services while providing unprecedented protection:

1. **Pre-Screening Technology**: When an unknown number calls, AI intercepts the call before the phone rings and asks the caller to identify themselves
2. **Real-Time Intent Analysis**: Advanced voice AI analyzes speech patterns, keywords, and behavioral markers to detect scam indicators
3. **Intelligent Whitelisting**: Family, friends, and trusted callers are recognized automatically and connected immediately
4. **Hard Guardrails**: Known scam patterns (impersonating HMRC, banks, utilities) are blocked instantly
5. **Payment Blocker™**: Prevents phone-based payments and contract sign-ups without appointed contact approval

The service also includes 'Call Memory'—a learning system that recognizes legitimate repeat callers (like a dog groomer or GP surgery) while flagging imposters attempting to use the same identity.

## Pricing and Availability

ScamBlocker launches with transparent, affordable pricing designed to make protection accessible to all UK households:

- **Landline Service**: £14.99/month (usually £24.99)
- **Mobile Protection**: £7.99/month  
- **Combined Protection**: £19.99/month
- **Setup Fee**: £29 (includes hardware and UK number porting)

All plans include unlimited calls to UK landlines and major mobile networks, with optional international calling bundles starting at £5/month.

The service is available immediately at scamblocker.co.uk with 48-hour setup and no engineer visit required. ScamBlocker is also available through the SONIQ Labs partner channel, enabling telecommunications resellers and service providers to offer the solution under their own brands.

## Technical Innovation

ScamBlocker represents a significant advancement in UK telecommunications infrastructure, built on SONIQ Labs' proven CPaaS platform:

- **Digital Landline Technology**: Works over broadband, eliminating reliance on aging copper infrastructure ahead of the 2027 PSTN switch-off
- **Voice AI Processing**: Real-time natural language processing powered by advanced voice AI models
- **Multi-Layer Protection**: Combines whitelist recognition, behavioral analysis, and pattern detection
- **Family Oversight**: Optional "appointed contact" feature allows adult children to receive alerts and approve unusual activity without taking control away from parents
- **DPA Compliant**: Full data protection compliance with transparent privacy policies
- **Enterprise Infrastructure**: Built on SONIQ Labs' carrier-grade CPaaS platform used by businesses across the UK

## Market Positioning

ScamBlocker enters a telecommunications market where traditional providers offer limited or reactive fraud protection. BT's Call Protect, for example, blocks known scam numbers but cannot prevent new threats or screen unknown callers in real-time.

"The difference is timing," explained Highfield. "Other services analyze recordings hours after a 20-minute scam call has already happened. We stop the call before it connects. The scammer never gets the chance to build trust, create urgency, or manipulate the victim."

The company estimates that early blocking could prevent 70-85% of successful telephone fraud attempts, potentially saving UK families hundreds of millions of pounds annually.

## Real-World Impact

Beta testing revealed compelling use cases beyond scam protection:

- **Dementia Care**: Families use ScamBlocker to protect parents with memory issues who may not recognize scam patterns
- **Power of Attorney**: Legal guardians use the appointed contact feature to supervise phone-based financial decisions
- **Isolated Elderly**: Reduces the fear of answering the phone that leads to social isolation
- **Small Business**: Self-employed and home workers gain professional call screening without hiring staff

## SONIQ Labs: From B2B to B2C

SONIQ Labs has established itself as a leading UK CPaaS provider, delivering enterprise communications solutions to businesses requiring advanced voice, messaging, and telecommunications capabilities. ScamBlocker represents the company's strategic expansion into the consumer market, applying enterprise-grade technology to solve a critical social problem.

"We've spent years building robust, scalable communications infrastructure for businesses," said Highfield. "ScamBlocker takes that same enterprise reliability and makes it accessible to every UK household. It's the natural evolution of our mission to make communications safer and more intelligent."

The partner channel strategy enables telecommunications resellers, care providers, and service organizations to white-label ScamBlocker, expanding its reach while maintaining SONIQ Labs' technical excellence.

## Industry Context

The UK telecommunications industry is undergoing massive transformation:

- **PSTN Shutdown**: BT's copper network closes in 2027, forcing millions onto digital alternatives
- **Fraud Epidemic**: Telephone fraud losses exceeded £1.2 billion in 2024 (UK Finance)
- **Aging Population**: 18% of UK population is over 65, with higher vulnerability to phone scams
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Ofcom and government increasing pressure on providers to combat fraud
- **CPaaS Growth**: UK communications platform market experiencing rapid expansion as businesses digitize

ScamBlocker positions SONIQ Labs as the first UK CPaaS provider to make scam protection—not connectivity—the primary product value for consumers.

## Future Development

SONIQ Labs plans to expand ScamBlocker's capabilities throughout 2026:

- **Live Call Monitoring**: Real-time AI analysis of active conversations with intervention capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Protection**: Extended screening for email and messaging platforms
- **Healthcare Integration**: Direct connection to NHS systems for medical appointment verification
- **Community Intelligence**: Shared threat database across ScamBlocker users
- **Partner Platform Expansion**: White-label solutions for care homes, local authorities, and telecommunications resellers

"We're building the infrastructure for a future where vulnerable people can answer their phones without fear," said Highfield. "That's not just a product feature—it's a fundamental human right in the digital age."

## Call to Action

For families with elderly parents, ScamBlocker provides an immediate solution to an urgent problem. For telecommunications partners, it represents a proven, enterprise-grade solution they can offer customers immediately.

For the telecommunications industry, it represents a new paradigm where protection is built into infrastructure rather than bolted on afterward.
