## The Bottom Line

**Blocking phone numbers to stop scammers is like:**
- Boarding up one window while they use the other 50,000 windows
- Blocking email addresses when they have unlimited emails
- Hiding from someone who can teleport

**It doesn't work. It has never worked. It will never work.**

**The phone system is fundamentally broken. Scammers know it. They exploit it. You can't fix it by blocking numbers.**

**But you can make your mum's phone only ring for people who identify themselves honestly.**

**That's not blocking. That's actual protection.**
