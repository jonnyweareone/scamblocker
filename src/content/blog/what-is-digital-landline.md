# Digital Landline UK: Everything You Need to Know (2026 Complete Guide)

*The future of UK landlines is digital. Here's what's changing, how it works, and why ScamBlocker's digital landline is different*

---

## What is a Digital Landline?

A **digital landline** (also called virtual landline, VoIP landline, or internet phone line) is a phone service that works over your broadband connection instead of traditional copper telephone wires.

**Simple version:** Your phone calls travel through the internet instead of old phone cables.

**Important:** It looks, sounds, and works exactly like your old landline. Same phone. Same number. Same everything. Just better protection and more features.

---

## Why Digital Landlines Are Replacing Traditional Ones

**By 2027, ALL UK landlines will be digital.** This isn't optional. BT is switching off the old copper network completely.

**Why?**
- Copper wires are 100+ years old
- Expensive to maintain
- Can't support modern services
- Everyone has broadband anyway

**What this means for you:**
- Your current landline WILL stop working
- You MUST switch to digital (or lose landline service)
- Better to switch now on your terms than wait until forced

## How a Digital Landline Works

**Traditional setup:**
Phone → Wall socket → Copper wires → Telephone exchange

**Digital setup:**
Phone → Adapter → Router → Broadband → Internet → Your call

**What you need:**
- ✅ Broadband connection (any speed works)
- ✅ Router with spare ethernet port
- ✅ Your existing phone

**What you DON'T need:**
- ❌ Engineer visit
- ❌ New phone
- ❌ Technical knowledge
- ❌ Phone socket in the wall

---

## Can I Keep My Existing Number?

**Yes!** This is called "number porting" and it's FREE.

**The process:**
1. Sign up for digital landline
2. Request to port your number
3. We handle everything with your old provider
4. Takes 5-10 working days
5. Your service continues uninterrupted
6. One day it just switches over automatically

**OR:** Choose a new number from any UK area code

---

## Will My Phone Work With a Digital Landline?

**Yes.** Any phone works:
- Corded phones
- Cordless phones (DECT)
- Old rotary phones (seriously)
- Fancy designer phones
- Cheap £10 Argos phones

**If it plugs into a phone socket, it'll work with the adapter.**

---

## What About During Power Cuts?

**Honest answer:** Digital landlines don't work during power cuts (no internet = no calls).

**Solutions:**
- Keep a mobile phone charged (most people do anyway)
- Get a UPS battery backup for your router (£50-100)
- Mobile signal works during power cuts

**Reality check:** Power cuts in the UK average 45 minutes per year. Mobile phones are the real emergency backup now.

## The ScamBlocker Digital Landline Difference

Most digital landlines are just... digital landlines. Same service, different technology.

**ScamBlocker is different because of AI scam protection:**

Every call is screened by AI before your phone rings:

1. **Unknown number calls**
2. **AI answers:** "This is ScamBlocker. Who are you calling for?"
3. **Legitimate caller:** States their name
4. **Your phone rings:** "There's a call from [name]. Accept or decline?"
5. **Scammers hang up** (can't pass screening)

**Result:**
- 89% of scam calls blocked automatically
- You never experience the panic of threats
- Family always gets through (whitelist)
- Perfect for protecting elderly parents

**Real story:**
"My mum is 81. She doesn't do computers, smartphones confuse her, but she loves her landline. 

When we switched to ScamBlocker's digital landline, nothing changed from her perspective. Same phone, same number, same ringtone.

**But in the first month, 11 scam calls were blocked that she never even heard.**

She has no idea how close she came to being scammed. And that's exactly how it should be."

— David, son of 81-year-old mother

## Common Questions

**Q: What internet speed do I need?**
A: Any broadband works. Voice calls use very little bandwidth. Even slow 10Mbps connections are fine.

**Q: Can I have multiple phones?**
A: Yes. The adapter has one port, but you can plug in a cordless phone base station that supports multiple handsets.

**Q: What if I change broadband provider?**
A: Your digital landline moves with you. Just plug the adapter into your new router.

**Q: Can I use it abroad?**
A: No. It needs to be connected to your UK broadband.

**Q: What if the internet goes down?**
A: Calls won't work (same as traditional landline if exchange goes down). Keep a mobile as backup.

**Q: Is call quality good?**
A: Excellent. Often better than traditional landlines (HD voice).
