**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## CPaaS Provider SONIQ Labs Launches AI Phone Service to Combat UK's £1.2bn Scam Crisis

**Portsmouth, 21 January 2026** – SONIQ Labs, a UK CPaaS provider operating under We Are One 1 Limited, today launched ScamBlocker™, an AI-powered digital landline service that screens unknown callers before vulnerable people answer, preventing telephone scammers from ever reaching their targets.

Unlike existing call-blocking services that react after scams occur, ScamBlocker uses real-time voice AI to intercept calls, ask callers to identify themselves, and analyze speech patterns to detect fraud indicators—all before the phone rings.

ScamBlocker is SONIQ Labs' first direct-to-consumer product, built on the company's enterprise-grade CPaaS infrastructure and available both directly and through the SONIQ Labs partner channel.

"81% of successful fraud begins with a phone call," said Philippa Highfield, Director at We Are One 1 Limited. "We stop scammers before they can build trust or create urgency. Other services analyze recordings hours later—by then, the damage is done."

### Key Features:
- **Pre-Call Screening**: AI interviews unknown callers before connecting
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Detects HMRC, bank, and utility impersonation
- **Payment Blocker™**: Prevents phone-based payments without approval
- **Call Memory**: Recognizes legitimate repeat callers, flags imposters
- **Family Oversight**: Optional alerts for adult children protecting parents

### Pricing:
- Landline: £14.99/month (usually £24.99)
- Mobile: £7.99/month
- Combined: £19.99/month
- Includes unlimited UK calls, optional international bundles from £5/month

The service replaces traditional landlines ahead of the 2027 PSTN shutdown, requiring no installation or engineer visit.

ScamBlocker is available immediately at **scamblocker.co.uk** with 14-day money-back guarantee and free number porting. Telecommunications partners can offer ScamBlocker through the SONIQ Labs partner channel.
