## 🎯 What Makes These Different from ChatGPT's

### ❌ ChatGPT's Approach:
- Generic "how-to" guides
- Too educational/academic
- Missing emotional hooks
- No real search intent
- Safe and boring

### ✅ Our Approach:
- **Real emotions:** Shame, fear, guilt, worry
- **Real stories:** Margaret losing £85k, Dad hiding scams
- **Real search intent:** "Mum got scammed again" not "how to prevent scams"
- **Family angle:** Written for adult children protecting parents
- **Urgency:** "They're calling right now"
- **No BS:** Direct, honest, emotional
